Game Script Essentails - JS edition
===

10/29/2017 - I found a dusty bookmark that lead to a page on "10 Essential Scripts" for game development in PHP: [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-php-gamescripts1/index.html/](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-php-gamescripts1/index.html/)

Seemed a good "back to basics" exercise to visit this in JS while being a solid example for others.

Technologies used:
---

- HTML
- JavaScript
- AngularJS
